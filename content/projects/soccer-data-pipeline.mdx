# Summary

Soccer Data Pipeline is an ETL system that ingests raw soccer data and transforms it into structured tables for downstream APIs and analytics.

## Problem / Motivation

Raw match data arrives in inconsistent formats and needs to be normalized quickly for real-time insights.

## Architecture

- Cloud Functions for ingest + transform
- Pub/Sub for event-driven processing
- Postgres as the canonical warehouse
- Terraform for repeatable infra

## Key Technical Decisions + Tradeoffs

- **Serverless functions** for bursty ingestion workloads, accepting cold starts as the tradeoff.
- **Postgres schema design** optimized for read-heavy API usage.

## Reliability / Performance / Security

- Idempotent transforms and retry logic
- Schema validation and deduplication
- Principle of least privilege for service accounts

## Results / Impact

- Reliable data availability for API consumers
- Reduced latency for live match updates

## What I’d Improve Next

- Add streaming analytics for near-real-time dashboards
- Extend coverage to additional data providers

## Evidence

- Pipeline diagram and repo link (GitLab)
