# Summary

Family Recipe App is a private, production-style web app that makes it easy for my family to post, discover, and preserve recipes with a social sharing experience.

## Problem / Motivation

We needed a centralized place to share recipes without relying on group chats or scattered notes, while keeping the system reliable, secure, and easy to maintain.

## Architecture

- Next.js frontend + API layer
- Python services for background processing
- Postgres for core data storage
- Terraform-managed infrastructure on GCP

## Key Technical Decisions + Tradeoffs

- **Next.js + API routes** for fast iteration while keeping deployment simple.
- **Terraform + managed services** to reduce operational overhead at the cost of higher upfront setup.
- **Production-first constraints** (auth, observability) to keep the system durable even for a small user base.

## Reliability / Performance / Security

- Health checks and monitoring dashboards
- Role-based access patterns and private hosting
- Focus on fast, predictable page loads

## Results / Impact

- Family members actively using the app to share meals
- Lower friction for posting and discovering recipes

## What I’d Improve Next

- Add recipe collections and meal planning
- Expand image optimization and search

## Evidence

- GitHub Repo
- Demo coming soon
