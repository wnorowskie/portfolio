# Summary

Student Service Center is a full-stack web app that centralizes critical university services in one place, designed with real user feedback.

## Problem / Motivation

Students had to navigate multiple portals to complete basic tasks. The goal was to reduce friction and provide a single hub for services.

## Architecture

- Next.js app deployed on Vercel
- SQLite-backed persistence for fast prototyping
- Lightweight UI system iterated in Figma

## Key Technical Decisions + Tradeoffs

- **SQLite + Vercel** for quick iteration, trading off horizontal scale.
- **Rapid UI prototyping** to validate workflows before deeper backend investment.

## Reliability / Performance / Security

- Simple, focused endpoints with minimal dependencies
- Security reviewed for common web vulnerabilities

## Results / Impact

- Students completed key workflows faster in usability tests
- Team iterated quickly based on feedback loops

## What I’d Improve Next

- Expand analytics and role-based permissions
- Add integrations with campus systems

## Evidence

- Screenshots and demo link coming soon
